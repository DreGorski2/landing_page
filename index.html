        <p class="section_text_content">
            I've spent the last 5 years working within the supply chain industry in particular the SAAS space where I have sold software services, implemented service offerings within customers systems, and acted in a consultant capacity ensuring customer got the most out our their services. All those experiences, unique as they were gave me a holistic view of the company and allowed me to better understand our strengths and weaknesses. And that is we're my software development journey begin, I noticed we had an entire team of people working day in and day out regression testing a core component of our service offering and it just simply could not scale with our companies goals. So I decided to try and find a better way which is when I started writing code and I have never looked back. Shortly after building out a solution that automated our regression testing process I was given an offer to take a job as a software engineer to continue to solve problem with technology. From there the rest is history I went from scripting and writing SQL queries to developing and supporting full blown applications in the cloud and continue to learn new things day in a day out, and am constantly amazed at the power technology has to empower people and transform the world!

            I specialize in python having written in it in a professional capacity for 2+ years. I'm also proficient  in cloud native architecture in particular aws for which I have deployed and manage numerous projects. I have also worked within many CRM applications linking data contained in these systems with company data most notably Salesforce, Jira, and Gainsight. To build off my backend knowledge i've been pursuing additional knowledge around JavaScript, React, HTML, and CSS.
